# Frontend: Mobile

For mobile frontend we suggest:
- Xamarin + Prism
- EF Core


## Why this?
_[Issue #9: Why on earth Xamarin is a good choice?]_

Xamarin is a well formed and mature technology for mobile development. But to rely on it we need a good training process to train Xamarin developers.


## Risks

The biggest risk of using Xamarin is lack of developers for it. If you want to invest on Xamarin, you should invest on having a good training program in your team. But the good news is that 80% of Xamarin is C#, so there is a lots of potential out there in the market that can easily learn Xamarin. The only difficult part that people should be trained from the scratch in is XAML. The main point about XAML is that it is not HTML and not easy as HTML. It is a completely new concept full of new software engineering standards, so it needs someone professional to enjoy it, otherwise if you are just beginner in XAML and good in HTML, it will be a headache.

In _CS Inernship_ program which we train Xamarin and C# developers, there are lots of interns coming from other languages like JavaScript, Java and Python. If you follow [#cs_internship on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cs_internship) and [#cs_internship on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=%23cs_internship) you can see how they are excited about learning Xamarin+C# and their fantastic features.

The other risk for Xamarin is that it is now owned by Microsoft, and lots of people just hate Mirosoft. Convincing people that Microsoft is not that scary monster that want to eat everything consumes lots of energy.

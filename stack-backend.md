# General Stack: Backend

For backend we suggest:
- Platform: .NET Core
- Language: C#
- Frameworks: EntityFramework Core, Autofac, OData, SignalR

## Why this?
_[What's great about .NET Core]_

_[The many environments that .NET Core can run on]_

_[Its performance in comparison with Node, Java and Go]_

_[How Roslyn makes it unreachable for other languages]_

_[It's tight future with WebAssembly]_

_[AI, IoT, Blazor, Xamarin.WebAssembly]_

## Risks
This stack is completely new. Since .NET Core 2.0 it is mature enough to be used in production. But EntityFramework Core 2.2 lacks some features yet. Although we are using it in our production projects but it seems it will be completely mature somewhere in version 3.*.

But the biggest risk is that it is a Microsoft product, and still there are lots of people that hate Microsoft. As this is a historical hatred usually it is so hard to convince those people as there is no reason behind their talks. It's just a grudge that came out of Balmer's Microsoft. As .NET is completely being developed in open source community it makes it easier to start the process of convincing.

# Architecture

## Suggestion
Micro-services? Monolithic?

We pick micro-service architecture because of its scalablity.
We are NOT picking it because it allows us to use multiple stacks concurrently.
In fact, we are against technology diversity.

Architecture items:
- Server-side
- SQL database
- NoSQL database
- Message Bus
- Rule Engine
- Workflow
- Web Frontend
- Mobile Frontend

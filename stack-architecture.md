# Architecture

Micro-services? Monolithic?

## Why this?
We pick micro-service architecture because of its scalablity.
We are NOT picking it because it allows us to use multiple stacks concurrently.
In fact, **we are against technology diversity**.

Architecture items:
- Server-side
- SQL database
- NoSQL database
- Message Bus
- Rule Engine
- Workflow
- Web Frontend
- Mobile Frontend

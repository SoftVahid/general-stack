# Problem Definition

Selecting a general stack to rely on for the next 3 years.
By stack, we mean:
 - Architecture
 - Platforms
 - Languages
 - Frameworks
 - Technologies

 This general stack is going to be used to develop all typical and general applications.
 It is obvious that in some situations, for some applicatoins with very specific requirements it is possible to customize the stack.
 But to stay focused on business, we try to keep the guidelines of general stack, unless it is revealed that the stack is not good for the situation, then will take the cost and will customize the stack.
